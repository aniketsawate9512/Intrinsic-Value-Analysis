# Intrinsic-Value-Analysis
Introduction
This five-year Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is designed to estimate the intrinsic value of publicly traded companies based on projected future cash flows. Leveraging financial data obtained through the yfinance API, this comprehensive valuation tool performs a series of complex calculations, including future revenue forecasts, EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), EBIAT (Earnings Before Interest After Taxes), Free Cash Flow, Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), and Terminal Value. The model's primary outputs are the implied stock price and the associated margin of safety, providing investors with crucial metrics for informed decision-making. Additionally, the model employs a bisection algorithm to compute the implied revenue growth rate that aligns the calculated stock price with the current market price, offering further insight into market expectations.
